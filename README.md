## Technologies Used
HTML | CSS | Javascript | jQuery | Mongoose | gMaps.js | NodeJS | Express | Google Maps API | Bootstrap

## Approach Taken
We wanted to create an app where users could input their own incidents that they see in realtime. They can enter what kind of incident it is, the address where the incident is, and add some additional comments on the specific situation. As a user goes on the website, they are able to see all incidents posted in the last twelve hours, but can only post an incident if they have an account. By clicking the markers on the map, any user can see the details of the incident including how long ago the incident was reported.
